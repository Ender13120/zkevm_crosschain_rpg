# zkevm_crosschain_rpg

**zkEVM - Planeswalkers** is an on-chain RPG that aims to show the power of zkEVM scaling. Players take control of formidable **characters on Ethereum** who traverse a portal into **the zkEVM realm**, battling adversaries, undertaking quests, and bringing their spoils **back to the Ethereum realm!**

### Innovative Mechanics:
<br />

**Dual-Chain Approach**: EVM-Planewalkers features game assets (NFTs) securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain, **while the game logic executes on Polygon's zkEVM.** This hybrid approach combines Ethereum's thriving NFT ecosystem with the **efficiency and affordability** of zkEVM transactions.

<br />

**Significantly Lower Gas Costs**: By running the game logic on the polygon zkEVM, players can experience the game with drastically reduced gas fees, ensuring a smooth and cost-effective gameplay experience.

<br />

**Trade on Ethereum**: As the NFTs are hosted on Ethereum, players can effortlessly trade and sell their assets within Ethereum's bustling NFT marketplace. The **NFT Ownership is broadcast trustlessly via the LxLy Bridge to the polygon zkEVM**, making them available for playing on the zkEVM.

<br />

**Unique Trustless Integration**: The game results occurring on the zkEVM are automatically and **trustlessly broadcast back to Ethereum** using the **zkEVMâ€™s zero-knowledge proof mechanism via the LxLy Bridge**. This means players can enjoy the game with the assurance that their achievements and rewards on the zkEVM are securely and verifiably recorded & claimable on the Ethereum blockchain.

<br />


### Key Features

**Player-Owned NFTs**: Players hold decentralized NFTs representing game characters and rewards on the Ethereum blockchain, granting them full control over their assets.

<br />

**Strategic Turn-Based PVP Combat**: Engage in riveting turn-based combat, employing a diverse range of abilities and tactics to vanquish enemies and emerge victorious.



This project specifically aims to highlight the immense efficiency gains that zkEVM's can enable with new smart contract architecture patterns, like the one demonstrated here. Eventually also aimed to become a zkEVM tutorial later on like https://cryptozombies.io/  is for smart-contracts.
